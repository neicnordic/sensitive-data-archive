# API

The API service provides data submitters with functionality to control
their submissions. Users are authenticated with a JWT.

## Service Description

Endpoints:

- `/files`
  1. Parses and validates the JWT token against the public keys, either locally provisioned or from OIDC JWK endpoints.
  2. The `sub` field from the token is extracted and used as the user's identifier
  3. All files belonging to this user are extracted from the database, together with their latest status and creation date

    Example:

    ```bash
    $ curl 'https://server/files' -H "Authorization: Bearer $token"
  [{"inboxPath":"requester_demo.org/data/file1.c4gh","fileStatus":"uploaded","createAt":"2023-11-13T10:12:43.144242Z"}] 
  ```

    It is possible to limit the returned results by supplying a base path prefix in the query. In this case only files that have a path that starts with `submission-1` will be returned.

    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" -X GET https://HOSTNAME/files?path_prefix=submission-1
    ```

  If the `token` is invalid, 401 is returned.

- `/datasets`
  - accepts `GET` requests
  - Returns all datasets, along with their status and last modified timestamp, for which the user has submitted data.

  - Error codes
    - `200` Query execute ok.
    - `400` Error due to bad payload.
    - `401` Token user is not in the list of admins.
    - `500` Internal error due to DB failures.

    Example:

    ```bash
    $curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" -X GET  https://HOSTNAME/datasets
    [{"DatasetID":"EGAD74900000101","Status":"deprecated","Timestamp":"2024-11-05T11:31:16.81475Z"}]
    ```

#### Configure RBAC

RBAC is configured according to the JSON schema below.
The path to the JSON file containing the RBAC policies needs to be passed through the `api.rbacFile` config definition.

The `policy` section will configure access to the defined endpoints. Unless specific rules are set, an endpoint will not be accessible.

- `action`: can be single string value i,e `GET` or a regex string with `|` as separator i.e. `(GET)|(POST)|(PUT)`. In the later case all actions in the list are allowed.
- `path`: the endpoint. Should be a string value with two different wildcard notations: `*`, matches any value and `:` that matches a specific named value
- `role`: the role that will be able to access the path, `"*"` will match any role or user.

The `roles` section defines the available roles

- `role`: rolename or username from the accesstoken
- `roleBinding`: maps a user/role to another role, this makes roles work as groups which simplifies the policy definitions.

```json
{
   "policy": [
      {
         "role": "admin",
         "path": "/c4gh-keys/*",
         "action": "(GET)|(POST)|(PUT)"
      },
      {
         "role": "submission",
         "path": "/file/ingest",
         "action": "POST"
      },
      {
         "role": "submission",
         "path": "/file/accession",
         "action": "POST"
      },
      {
         "role": "submission",
         "path": "/users",
         "action": "GET"
      },
      {
         "role": "submission",
         "path": "/users/:username/files",
         "action": "GET"
      },
      {
         "role": "*",
         "path": "/files",
         "action": "GET"
      }
   ],
   "roles": [
      {
         "role": "admin",
         "rolebinding": "submission"
      },
      {
         "role": "dummy@example.org",
         "rolebinding": "admin"
      },
