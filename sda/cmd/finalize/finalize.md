# finalize Service

Handles the so-called _Accession ID (stable ID)_ to filename mappings from `CentralEGA`.
At the same time the service fulfills the replication requirement of having distinct backup copies.
For more information see [Federated EGA Node Operations v2](https://ega-archive.org/assets/files/EGA-Node-Operations-v2.pdf) document.

## Service Description

`Finalize` adds stable, shareable _Accession ID_'s to archive files.
If a backup location is configured it will perform backup of a file.
When running, `finalize` reads messages from the configured RabbitMQ queue (commonly: `accession`).
For each message, these steps are taken (if not otherwise noted, errors halt progress and the service moves on to the next message):

1. The message is validated as valid JSON that matches the `ingestion-accession` schema. 
    - If the message canâ€™t be validated it is discarded with an error message in the logs.
2. If the service is configured to perform backups i.e. the `ARCHIVE_` and `BACKUP_` storage backend are set. Archived files will be copied to the backup location.
   1. The file size on disk is requested from the storage system.
   2. The database file size is compared against the disk file size.
   3. A file reader is created for the archive storage file, and a file writer is created for the backup storage file.
3. The file data is copied from the archive file reader to the backup file writer.
4. If the type of the `DecryptedChecksums` field in the message is `sha256`, the value is stored.
5. A new RabbitMQ `complete` message is created and validated against the `ingestion-completion` schema. 
    - If the validation fails, an error message is written to the logs.
6. The file accession ID in the message is marked as *ready* in the database. 
    - On error the service sleeps for up to 5 minutes to allow for database recovery, after 5 minutes the message is Nacked, re-queued and an error message is written to the logs.
7. The complete message is sent to RabbitMQ. On error, a message is written to the logs.
8. The original RabbitMQ message is Ack'ed.

## Communication

- `Finalize` reads messages from one RabbitMQ queue (commonly: `accession`).
- `Finalize` publishes messages with one routing key  (commonly: `completed`).
- `Finalize` assigns the accession ID to a file in the database using the `SetAccessionID` function.

## Configuration

There are a number of options that can be set for the `finalize` service.
These settings can be set by mounting a yaml-file at `/config.yaml` with settings.
ex.

```yaml
log:
  level: "debug"
  format: "json"
```

They may also be set using environment variables like:

```bash
export LOG_LEVEL="debug"
export LOG_FORMAT="json"
```

### RabbitMQ broker settings

These settings control how `finalize` connects to the RabbitMQ message broker.

- `BROKER_HOST`: hostname of the RabbitMQ server
- `BROKER_PORT`: RabbitMQ broker port (commonly: `5671` with TLS and `5672` without)
- `BROKER_QUEUE`: message queue to read messages from (commonly: `accession`)
- `BROKER_ROUTINGKEY`: Routing key for publishing messages (commonly: `completed`)
- `BROKER_USER`: username to connect to RabbitMQ
- `BROKER_PASSWORD`: password to connect to RabbitMQ
- `BROKER_PREFETCHCOUNT`: Number of messages to pull from the message server at the time (default to `2`)
- `BROKER_EXCHANGE`= the exchange name (i.e., `sda`)

### PostgreSQL Database settings

- `DB_HOST`: hostname for the postgresql database
- `DB_PORT`: database port (commonly: `5432`)
- `DB_USER`: username for the database
- `DB_PASSWORD`: password for the database
- `DB_DATABASE`: database name
- `DB_SSLMODE`: The TLS encryption policy to use for database connections, valid options are:
    - `disable`
    - `allow`
    - `prefer`
    - `require`
    - `verify-ca`
    - `verify-full`

  More information is available
  [in the postgresql documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html#LIBPQ-SSL-PROTECTION)

  Note that if `DB_SSLMODE` is set to anything but `disable`, then `DB_CACERT` needs to be set,
  and if set to `verify-full`, then `DB_CLIENTCERT`, and `DB_CLIENTKEY` must also be set.

- `DB_CLIENTKEY`: key-file for the database client certificate
- `DB_CLIENTCERT`: database client certificate file
- `DB_CACERT`: Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for the database to use

### Logging settings

- `LOG_FORMAT` can be set to `json` to get logs in JSON format. All other values result in text logging.
- `LOG_LEVEL` can be set to one of the following, in increasing order of severity:
    - `trace`
    - `debug`
    - `info`
    - `warn` (or `warning`)
    - `error`
    - `fatal`
    - `panic`

### Storage settings

Storage backend is defined by the `ARCHIVE_TYPE`, and `BACKUP_TYPE` variables.
Valid values for these options are `S3` or `POSIX`
(Defaults to `POSIX` on unknown values).

The value of these variables define what other variables are read.
The same variables are available for all storage types, differing by prefix (`ARCHIVE_`, or `BACKUP_`)

if `*_TYPE` is `S3` then the following variables are available:

- `*_URL`: URL to the S3 system
- `*_ACCESSKEY`: The S3 access and secret key are used to authenticate to S3,
[more info at AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys)
- `*_SECRETKEY`: The S3 access and secret key are used to authenticate to S3,
[more info at AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys)
- `*_BUCKET`: The S3 bucket to use as the storage root
- `*_PORT`: S3 connection port (default: `443`)
- `*_REGION`: S3 region (default: `us-east-1`)
- `*_CHUNKSIZE`: S3 chunk size for multipart uploads.
- `*_CACERT`: Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for the storage system, this is only needed if the S3 server has a certificate signed by a private entity

and if `*_TYPE` is `POSIX`:

- `*_LOCATION`: POSIX path to use as storage root
